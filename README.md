[Definition from wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)
Concurrency computing is a form of computing in which several computations are executed concurrently.

Difference between Concurrency and Parallel:
- Parallel computing: execution occurs at the same physical instant.
- Concurrent computing: consists of process lifetimes overlapping, but execution need not happen at the same instant.

Why is it important?
- Obviously, we love performance speed-up.
